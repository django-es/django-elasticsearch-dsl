Testing
=======


You can run the tests by creating a Python virtual environment, installing
the requirements from ``requirements_test.txt`` (``pip install -r requirements_test``)::

    $ python runtests.py


For integration testing with a running Elasticsearch server::

    $ python runtests.py --elasticsearch [localhost:9200]

TODO
====
 
- Add support for --using (use another Elasticsearch cluster) in management commands.
- Add management commands for mapping level operations (like update_mapping....).
- Generate ObjectField/NestField properties from a Document class.
- More examples.
- Better ``ESTestCase`` and documentation for testing
